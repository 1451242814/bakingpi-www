					This course has not yet been updated to work with the Raspberry Pi models B+
					and A+. Some elements may not work, in particular the first few lessons about the
					LED.
				</p>
				<p>
					Welcome to Baking Pi: Operating Systems Development! Course by <a href="mailto:awc32@cam.ac.uk">Alex Chadwick</a>. Version 1.0c (July 2013).</p>
				<p>
					This website is here to guide you through the process of developing <em>very</em>
					basic operating systems on the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi homepage">
						Raspberry Pi</a>! This website is aimed at people aged 16 and upwards, although
					younger readers may still find some of it accessible, particularly with assistance.
					More lessons may be added to this course in time.
				</p>
				<p>
					This course takes you through the basics of operating systems development in assembly
					code. I have tried not to assume any prior knowledge of operating systems development
					or assembly code. It may be helpful to have some programming experience, but the
					course should be accessible without.
					The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=72">Raspberry Pi forums</a> are full of friendly people ready to help you out if you run into trouble. This course is divided into a series of 'lessons'
					designed to be taken in order as below. Each 'lesson' includes some theory, and
					also a practical exercise, complete with a full answer.</p>
				<p>
					Rather than leading the reader through the full details of creating an Operating
					System, these tutorials focus on achieving a few common tasks separately. Hopefully,
					by the end, the reader should know enough about Operating Systems that they could
					try to put together everything they've learned and make one. Although the lessons
					are generally focused on creating very specific things, there is plenty of room
					to play with what you learn. Perhaps, after reading the lesson on functions, you
					imagine a better style of assembly code. Perhaps after the lessons on graphics you
					imagine a 3D operating system. Since this is an Operating Systems course, you will
					have the power to design things how you like. If you have an idea, try it! Computer
					Science is still a young subject, and so there is plenty left to discover!

					1 Requirements</h2>
				<p>
					In order to complete this course you will need a Raspberry Pi with an SD card and
					power supply, as well as another computer running a version of Linux, Microsoft
					Windows or Mac OS X, capable of writing to the SD card, and installing software.
					It is helpful, but not necessary, for your Raspberry Pi to be able to be connected
					to a screen.</p>
				<p>
					In terms of software, you require a GNU compiler toolchain that targets ARMv6. Links
					for downloads are available on the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads Page</a>, along
					with model answers for all of the exercises.</p>
